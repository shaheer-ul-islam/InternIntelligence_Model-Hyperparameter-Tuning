## **Random Forest & XGBoost  Model Performance Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning**

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of an XGBoost model using cross-validation and key classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). Additionally, it includes hyperparameter tuning to improve the model and a visualization of performance differences.

## 🚀 Project Features

Base Model Training & Evaluation: Initial performance analysis using default XGBoost settings.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization using GridSearchCV, Random Search, Bayesian Search, and Optuna.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score comparisons before and after tuning.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries Used:

**xgboost**

sklearn

matplotlib

seaborn

numpy

optuna
